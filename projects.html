      <h3>Satellites And Spacelaunch Workshop</h3>
      <p>Launched minds, not just rockets! We explored satellite tech, orbital mechanics, and the thrill of sending objects to spaceâ€”all hands-on and fun on the occasion of ISRO's spaDEX launch.</p>

      <h3>Yuvana Contributions (2024)</h3>
      <p>Organizing Members of Physics and Biology Committees and participated in main-day Chemistry events. We built projects like a biological boardgame that took the spotlight and showcased experiments on optics and solar-powered cars. Beyond STEM, you could find us in the theatrical plays, the Arts & Sustainability corner with our recycled paper works, and more!</p>

        <h3>Coding initiatives</h3>
        <p>Fatima Shams has several ongoing and existing coding projects that aim to have social implications or act as infographics or tools like the GameOfLife. Radhika </p>

         <h3>Theatre! Poetry! and Art!</h3>
        <p>The poets and artists in us have shined through our work as the artists we are (Yes, we are aware this is a science club but what is a geek who has not envoked  the spirit of art and drama.)</p>

      <div class="work-card">
        <h3>Breakthrough Junior Challenge</h3>
        <p>Created an animated video on spontaneous symmetry breaking as the root cause for existence.</p>

        <h3>Ideathons and ThinkTanks </h3>
        <p>Innovation is the way ideas take life, so we, especially Fatima, have taken our time to think of solutions to problems that the world urgently needs addressed. For example, In a Think-tank 2025 event, a creative solution to solve the problem of potholes before they even form was put forward by Team Induct, backed by physics and chemistry, and was appreciated and won at the event. Solutions for Air pollution, space-debris and more have been presented by our members in various ideathons and similar events through the years, embodying our main theme- to truly apply the corenrstones of STEM into the real world.</p>
